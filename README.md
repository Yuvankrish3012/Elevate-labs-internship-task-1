## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to understand the provided dataset using statistical analysis and various visualizations. This involves exploring the data to identify patterns, trends, or anomalies, and making basic feature-level inferences from the visuals.

**Tools Used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Analysis

The following steps were performed for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset, with analysis based on the provided images:

### 1. Initial Data Overview (Histograms of Numerical Features)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1243f02f-9850-416c-a462-4d6d18cb2e4d)


This image displays histograms for all numerical columns in the dataset: `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, and `Fare`.

* **`PassengerId`**: Shows a uniform distribution, as expected for unique identifiers.
* **`Survived`**: Clearly indicates an imbalanced dataset, with significantly more passengers not surviving (0) than surviving (1).
* **`Pclass`**: Shows that `Pclass 3` has the highest number of passengers, followed by `Pclass 1` and then `Pclass 2`.
* **`Age`**: Reveals a right-skewed distribution, with a higher concentration of younger passengers (around 20-30 years old) and fewer older passengers.
* **`SibSp` (Siblings/Spouses Aboard)**: The majority of passengers traveled alone or with one sibling/spouse. Very few traveled with more than two.
* **`Parch` (Parents/Children Aboard)**: Similar to `SibSp`, most passengers traveled without parents or children, or with one or two.
* **`Fare`**: Highly right-skewed, indicating that most passengers paid lower fares, with a few outliers paying very high fares.

### 2. Age Distribution by Passenger Class (Boxplot)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af858921-71cf-417c-a6ff-15f8356407e0)


This boxplot visualizes the distribution of `Age` across different `Pclass` categories.

* **`Pclass 1`**: Passengers in first class tend to be older, with a median age around 37-38. The age range is wider, but outliers extend to around 80.
* **`Pclass 2`**: The median age for second class passengers is slightly lower than first class, around 29-30. The age distribution is also narrower than first class.
* **`Pclass 3`**: Passengers in third class are generally the youngest, with a median age around 24-25. This class also shows a significant number of outliers, including very young children.
* **Overall**: There's a clear trend: as passenger class decreases (from 1 to 3), the median age of passengers also tends to decrease. This suggests that wealthier (first-class) passengers were generally older.

### 3. Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b83277-ebe1-4c7d-872d-b636111b6bae)


This heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between all numerical features. The color intensity and value indicate the strength and direction of the correlation.

* **`Survived` vs. `Pclass`**: A strong negative correlation (-0.34) indicates that passengers in lower classes (higher `Pclass` number) had a lower chance of survival.
* **`Survived` vs. `Fare`**: A positive correlation (0.26) suggests that passengers who paid higher fares had a better chance of survival.
* **`Pclass` vs. `Fare`**: A strong negative correlation (-0.55) is observed, meaning higher passenger classes (lower `Pclass` number) are associated with higher fares.
* **`Age` vs. `Pclass`**: A negative correlation (-0.37) implies that older passengers tended to be in higher classes.
* **`SibSp` and `Parch`**: These two features show a moderate positive correlation (0.41), which is expected as they both relate to family size.
* **Other correlations**: Most other correlations are weak, indicating less direct linear relationships.

### 4. Pairplot of Key Features (Age, Fare, Pclass, Survived)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9b5ff34-bd1f-4922-b27c-70e5dfe0967b)


This pairplot shows scatter plots for every combination of `Age`, `Fare`, and `Pclass`, with points colored by `Survived` status (0 for not survived, 1 for survived). The diagonal plots show kernel density estimates (KDEs) for each feature, split by survival status.

* **`Age` Distribution by Survival**: The KDE for `Age` on the diagonal shows that the distribution of ages for survivors (orange) is slightly shifted towards younger ages compared to non-survivors (blue), although there's significant overlap.
* **`Fare` Distribution by Survival**: The KDE for `Fare` on the diagonal clearly indicates that survivors (orange) tend to have paid higher fares, with a much wider spread towards higher values, while non-survivors (blue) are heavily concentrated at lower fares.
* **`Pclass` Distribution by Survival**: The KDE for `Pclass` on the diagonal strongly highlights that `Pclass 1` has a higher proportion of survivors, while `Pclass 3` has a significantly higher proportion of non-survivors.
* **`Age` vs. `Fare`**: The scatter plot shows a general trend where higher fares are paid by a wider range of ages, and survivors are more prevalent among those who paid higher fares.
* **`Age` vs. `Pclass`**: The scatter plot reinforces that `Pclass 1` (bottom row of `Pclass` values) has older passengers, and a higher survival rate is observed in this group. `Pclass 3` (top row of `Pclass` values) has younger passengers and a lower survival rate.
* **`Fare` vs. `Pclass`**: The scatter plot shows distinct clusters for each `Pclass`. `Pclass 1` has the highest fares, `Pclass 2` has moderate fares, and `Pclass 3` has the lowest fares. Survival is more common in the higher fare/lower `Pclass` clusters.
* **Overall**: The pairplot effectively visualizes the interplay between these key features and their impact on survival, reinforcing that `Fare` and `Pclass` are strong indicators of survival, and `Age` plays a role, particularly in conjunction with `Pclass`.

# Elevate-labs-internship-task-4

## Objective
To build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on a suitable dataset, evaluate its performance using various metrics, understand threshold tuning, and explain key machine learning concepts related to binary classification[cite: 1, 5].

## Tools Used
* Python
* Scikit-learn [cite: 2]
* Pandas [cite: 2]
* Matplotlib [cite: 2]

## Dataset
For this task, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset was used[cite: 5]. This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, used to predict whether a mass is benign (B) or malignant (M).

## Task Steps & Implementation

1.  **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing:**
    * The dataset was loaded using Pandas.
    * Irrelevant columns (like `Unnamed: 32` and `id`) were removed.
    * Missing values were dropped.
    * The `diagnosis` column was converted to a binary format: 'M' (Malignant) mapped to 1, and 'B' (Benign) mapped to 0.

2.  **Train/Test Split and Feature Standardization:**
    * The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. `stratify=y` was used to maintain the proportion of classes in both sets.
    * `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn was used to standardize the features[cite: 3], which is crucial for algorithms like Logistic Regression to ensure features contribute equally to the distance calculations.

3.  **Logistic Regression Model Training:**
    * A `LogisticRegression` model was initialized and trained on the scaled training data[cite: 3].

4.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * The model's performance was evaluated using:
        * **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions[cite: 4, 7].
        * **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions[cite: 4, 7].
        * **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances[cite: 4, 7].
        * **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve):** A metric that measures the overall performance of a binary classifier across all possible classification thresholds[cite: 4, 7]. An AUC of 1.0 indicates a perfect model.

### Evaluation Results (Default Threshold)

Confusion Matrix:
[[71  1]
[ 3 39]]
Precision: 0.97
Recall: 0.93
ROC-AUC: 1.00


5.  **ROC Curve:**
    * The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate at various threshold settings. The area under this curve (AUC) provides an aggregate measure of performance[cite: 4, 7].

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5adcbda-49ec-4e5a-99d6-0b86b88eabf0)

6.  **Threshold Tuning:**
    * Logistic Regression models output probabilities. A threshold is used to convert these probabilities into binary class predictions. The default threshold is typically 0.5[cite: 4].
    * Tuning the threshold allows us to adjust the balance between precision and recall based on the specific needs of the problem[cite: 4, 8]. For instance, in medical diagnosis, it might be more critical to maximize recall (minimize false negatives) even if it means a slight reduction in precision.
    * An example of adjusting the threshold to 0.3 was demonstrated.

### Evaluation Results (Threshold = 0.3)

With threshold = 0.3:
Confusion Matrix:
[[71  1]
[ 1 41]]
Precision: 0.98
Recall: 0.98

*Note: Adjusting the threshold from 0.5 to 0.3 in this instance improved recall from 0.93 to 0.98, with a slight increase in precision, indicating a better identification of positive cases without significantly increasing false positives.*

7.  **Sigmoid Function:**
    * The sigmoid function (also known as the logistic function) is a key component of Logistic Regression[cite: 4, 6]. It maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for interpreting as a probability.
    * The formula for the sigmoid function is $ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $.
    * It produces an S-shaped curve, squashing the input values into a probability scale.
